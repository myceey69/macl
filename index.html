      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Mario Chong Loo, and I was born in a small country that I proudly
        call home, Panama. I grew up without a father and was raised by the most loving
        mother in the world. I have four siblings: two boys and two girls. I came to
        the United States when I was 16 to pursue a better education and career.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am a passionate and driven individual pursuing a career in technology. I
        strive to grow personally and professionally through continuous learning,
        hands-on projects, and meaningful connections.
