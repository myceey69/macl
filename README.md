Hi, my name is **Mario Chong Loo**.
I'm passionate about bringing ideas to life through technology and creativity. I enjoy building projects that challenge me to grow as a developer, problem solver, and innovator. Whether it's a personal project, a collaborative effort, or a contribution to a greater cause, I find joy in the process of creating something meaningful from the ground up.

This is my personal website â€” a space where I showcase my work, share what I'm learning, and document my journey in tech and beyond. Feel free to explore my projects, learn more about me, or get in touch!
